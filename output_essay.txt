In addition, my knowledge of business, specifically accounting, will be an asset to the company because of the degree to which I will be able to understand the business challenges that assorted customers face. I will accomplish my MS in information processing system scientific discipline from Northwestern University in December 2014. My undergraduate degree was in accounting, and I have followed up with my undergraduate degree by sitting for 2 of the 4 tests necessitated for the CPA, passing both tests on the first endeavour. I have single-handedly built two iOS apps from scratch, Sleep Gadget and Prayer Vault, and learnt much about the lifecycle of an app, from prototypping to customer support. Over the summertime, I worked with a professor at a merchandising analytics company to build a splashboard to monitor Google Analytics and Facebook data points. In addition to other accomplishments, the undertaking necessitated knowledge of PHP, jQuery, and database management, none of which I had much experience with. Notwithstanding, after the first hebdomad I was comfortable with each of these engineerings, and by the end of the three calendar month undertaking consider myself rattling familiar with them. CSG is a world-wide leader in business solutions, and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my accomplishments to such an impressive organization. Unfeignedly,
